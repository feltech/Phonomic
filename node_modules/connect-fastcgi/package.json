  "readme": "# What\n\nconnect middleware to pass requests to FastCGI server process.\n\n# Why\n\nBecause PHP-FPM. Yes, that's right, it's insanity, but I need it, mainly\nfor development and automated testing tasks I do with grunt and simple\nnode.js scripts.\n\nThis module is a stripped down version of this\nhttps://github.com/davidcoallier/node-php server converted to connect\nmiddleware. It was then modified to support POST and PUT, pass\nrequired headers etc.\n\n# How\n\n```javascript\nvar connect = require('connect'), \n    php = require('../connect-fastcgi');\n\nvar app = connect()\n        .use('/php', php({ fastcgiPort: 8002, fastcgiHost: 'localhost', root: \"./php\" }))\n        .use(connect.logger())\n        .use(connect.static('./assets'))\n        .listen(3000);\n```\n\nAvailable options:\n\n- `root:` root directory for scripts\n- `fastcgiHost:` host or socket path to FastCGI process\n- `fastcgiPort:` port\n\n# Thanks\n\n[David Coallier](https://github.com/davidcoallier) for original node-php module\n\n",
